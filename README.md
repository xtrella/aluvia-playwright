# Aluvia Playwright Proxy Wrapper

[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-Ready-blue.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

Automatically retry failed [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) navigations using real mobile proxies from [Aluvia](https://www.aluvia.io).

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Proxy Renewal on Failure** - When a navigation fails, a new Aluvia proxy is fetched and the browser is relaunched automatically.
- **Automatic Retries** - Retries `page.goto()` based on error patterns you define (e.g. `ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNRESET`).
- **Event Preservation** - Page event listeners remain active after a retry or relaunch.
- **Drop-in Replacement** - Import from `aluvia-playwright` instead of `playwright`; everything else stays the same.
- **TypeScript Ready** - Full typings for all patched Playwright APIs.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install aluvia-playwright
```

```bash
yarn add aluvia-playwright
```

```bash
pnpm add aluvia-playwright
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```typescript
import { chromium } from "aluvia-playwright";

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();
const page = await context.newPage();

await page.goto("https://blocked-website.com");

// Interact with the page as usual
const title = await page.title();
console.log("Page title:", title);

await page.mouse.wheel(0, 1000);
await page.click("a.some-link");

// Run custom JavaScript in the page context
const headline = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const el = document.querySelector("h1");
  return el ? el.textContent?.trim() : "No headline found";
});
console.log("Headline:", headline);

await browser.close();
```

All Playwright browser types (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`) are supported. The wrapper automatically applies proxy and retry logic to all new pages and contexts.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables to control proxy and retry behavior:

| Variable             | Description                                                  | Default                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `ALUVIA_API_KEY`     | **Required.** Your Aluvia API key.                           | _None_                                  |
| `ALUVIA_MAX_RETRIES` | Maximum number of navigation retries before failing.         | `1`                                     |
| `ALUVIA_BACKOFF_MS`  | Milliseconds to wait between retries.                        | `300`                                   |
| `ALUVIA_RETRY_ON`    | Comma-separated list of error substrings to trigger a retry. | `ECONNRESET,ETIMEDOUT,net::ERR,Timeout` |

Example `.env` file:

```env
ALUVIA_API_KEY=your_aluvia_api_key
ALUVIA_MAX_RETRIES=2
ALUVIA_BACKOFF_MS=500
ALUVIA_RETRY_ON=ECONNRESET,ETIMEDOUT,net::ERR,Timeout
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. You call `page.goto(url)` as usual.
2. If Playwright throws an error matching `ALUVIA_RETRY_ON`, the wrapper:

   - Requests a fresh proxy from the Aluvia API.
   - Relaunches the browser using that proxy.
   - Re-binds your existing page events and retries the navigation.

3. If the retry also fails, it backs off (with jitter) and tries again, up to `ALUVIA_MAX_RETRIES`.

All of this happens automatically - you keep the same page object reference and your event listeners still work.

## 📚 API Notes

This package re-exports the standard Playwright API but overrides the browser launch methods:

- `chromium.launch()`
- `firefox.launch()`
- `webkit.launch()`

Every page or context created from these browsers automatically uses the retry + proxy logic. There are no new public methods - you use Playwright exactly as before.

## 📦 Requirements

- Node.js >= 16
