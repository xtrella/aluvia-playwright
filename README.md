The **official Playwright wrapper for Aluvia mobile proxies**. This lightweight, TypeScript-first package transparently adds proxy rotation and retry logic to Playwright, making your automation more robust against network errors—without changing your app code or breaking your existing page event listeners.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Automatic Proxy Rotation**: Seamlessly relaunches Playwright pages with fresh Aluvia proxies on network errors
- 🔁 **Auto-Retry Navigation**: Retries `page.goto()` transparently when errors match your configured patterns
- 🧩 **Drop-in Replacement**: No code changes required—just swap your Playwright import
- 🏷️ **TypeScript Ready**: Full type definitions for all patched Playwright APIs
- 🪝 **Event Mirroring**: Keeps your page event listeners working after proxy switches
- ⚡ **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, fast startup

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install aluvia-playwright
```

```bash
yarn add aluvia-playwright
```

```bash
pnpm add aluvia-playwright
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```typescript
import pw from "aluvia-playwright";

const browser = await pw.chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");
```

All Playwright browser types (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`) are supported. The wrapper automatically applies proxy and retry logic to all new pages and contexts.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables to control proxy and retry behavior:

| Variable             | Description                                                  | Default                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `ALUVIA_API_KEY`     | **Required.** Your Aluvia API key.                           | _None_                                  |
| `ALUVIA_MAX_RETRIES` | Maximum number of navigation retries before failing.         | `1`                                     |
| `ALUVIA_BACKOFF_MS`  | Milliseconds to wait between retries.                        | `300`                                   |
| `ALUVIA_RETRY_ON`    | Comma-separated list of error substrings to trigger a retry. | `ECONNRESET,ETIMEDOUT,net::ERR,Timeout` |

Example `.env` file:

```env
ALUVIA_API_KEY=your_aluvia_api_key
ALUVIA_MAX_RETRIES=2
ALUVIA_BACKOFF_MS=500
ALUVIA_RETRY_ON=ECONNRESET,ETIMEDOUT,net::ERR,Timeout
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

- On navigation (`page.goto`), if a retryable error occurs, the wrapper fetches a new proxy from Aluvia and relaunches the browser/page with the new proxy.
- All page events are mirrored to ensure listeners remain functional after a proxy switch.
- The wrapper is transparent: you interact with Playwright as usual.

## 📚 API Reference

This package exports the Playwright API, with all browser types patched for proxy and retry logic. All standard Playwright methods are available.

### Patched Playwright API

All Playwright browser types (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`) are patched:

- `pw.chromium.launch()`
- `pw.firefox.launch()`
- `pw.webkit.launch()`

All contexts and pages created from these browsers will automatically use Aluvia proxies and retry logic.

#### Navigation Retry Logic

- `page.goto(url)` will retry up to `ALUVIA_MAX_RETRIES` times if errors match any substring in `ALUVIA_RETRY_ON`.
- On retry, a new proxy is fetched from Aluvia and the browser/page is relaunched.
- All page events are mirrored to the new page, so listeners remain functional.
