## Development Process

### Pull Requests
- Fork the [repository](https://github.com/xtrella/aluvia-playwright).

- Ensure your PR describes the change clearly and references any related issues.

### Development Setup

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aluvia-playwright.git
   cd aluvia-playwright
   ```

### Code Style

- Prefer descriptive variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces).
- Run `npm run build` before submitting.

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:

- `feat(proxy): add sticky session support`
- `fix(auth): handle invalid token errors`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
